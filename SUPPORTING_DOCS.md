# Take-Home Assignment

## Demo Intro

Hi Jeff,

Here's some info I put together for you to help you understand what you can do with Dynamic.

This is the demo app: https://github.com/pacrob/dynamic-customer-demo

And here's a video walk-through of its use: https://www.loom.com/share/d650708d5cfe4935b7a45b5477c610c6?sid=bdbf3410-6d4d-41a3-9ddd-2c699466325d

In the video, I'll walk you through the log-in process using Dynamic's tooling. You'll see our support for a wide variety of existing wallets as well as a demonstration of how Dynamic's Embedded Wallets work.

In the Developer Dashboard, we'll look at enabling different chains, the additional security options you can provide for your users, and see how you can choose to sponsor your users' gas via our Account Abstraction integrations.

Back in the app, I'll demo 2 different types of transaction. The first is a basic value transfer, sending some test ETH from one address to another. I'll also show how setting up an Account Abstraction provider allows a token-minting transaction to be initiated even when the account has no balance. One note here - your message asked about minting NFTs, while in the video I demoed minting a fungible token. The tokens themselves are different, but the process of minting would be the same.

Here are some links to things I mention in the video:

This is our `create-dynamic-app` tool that I used to create the demo:

Here's some more detail on Smart Wallets, aka Account Abstraction

Thanks again for your interest in Dynamic, Jeff! Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.

## Technical Welcome Message

Hi Jeff,

We're excited to welcome you to Dynamic. We're here to make wallet integration easy for developers and wallet use seamless for users, with no compromises on security.

Here's how you can get started with the Dynamic SDK:

### Connect your wallet in minutes

First, take a look at our [Quickstart guide](https://www.dynamic.xyz/docs/quickstart). This will give you everything you need to get the Dynamic login flow working in your app. If you'd prefer to start from scratch, we recommend our [`create-dynamic-app`](https://www.dynamic.xyz/docs/example-apps#create-dynamic-app) tool. For both options, you'll need your Environment ID, which can be found at the top of your [Developer Dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/).

### Try it live

Check out our [demo app](https://demo.dynamic.xyz/)  to see Dynamic in action — connect with email, social, or wallet, play with a multitude of layout options, and explore multi-chain support.  

### Go deeper
