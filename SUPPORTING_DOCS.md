## Technical Welcome Message

Hi Jeff,

We're excited to welcome you to Dynamic. We're here to make wallet integration easy for developers and wallet use seamless for users, with no compromises on security.

Here's how you can get started with the Dynamic SDK:

### Connect your wallet in minutes

First, take a look at our [Quickstart guide](https://www.dynamic.xyz/docs/quickstart). This will give you everything you need to get the Dynamic login flow working in your app. If you'd prefer to start from scratch, we recommend our [`create-dynamic-app`](https://www.dynamic.xyz/docs/example-apps#create-dynamic-app) tool. For both options, you'll need your Environment ID, which can be found at the top of your [Developer Dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/).

### Try it live

Check out our [demo app](https://demo.dynamic.xyz/)  to see Dynamic in action — connect with email, social, or wallet, play with a multitude of layout options, and explore multi-chain support.  

### Go deeper

- Learn about our [Embedded Wallets](https://www.dynamic.xyz/docs/wallets/embedded-wallets/mpc/overview): let your users create non-custodial wallets with just an email.
- Explore Smart Wallets, aka [Account Abstraction](https://www.dynamic.xyz/docs/smart-wallets/add-smart-wallets): simplify gas fees for your users.
- Check out our [Supported Chains](https://www.dynamic.xyz/docs/chains/enabling-chains): we're proud to say we support the most wallets and chains of any wallet library out there.

### Don't go alone

Join our [Slack](https://www.dynamic.xyz/slack) community to connect with our engineers and others users. Prefer email? Just hit reply and we'll get right back to you.

Thanks again for choosing Dynamic. We can’t wait to see what you build.
