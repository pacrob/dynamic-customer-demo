This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Add your Environment ID

To connect the app to your Dynamic account, you'll need to create a `.env` file with your `Environment Id`.
There is an example in this folder under the name `.env.example`.

You can find your `Environment Id` at the top of your [Dynamic Dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/overview).

Just paste it in place of `your-environment-id-here` in the example file, save as `.env`, and you'll be good to go!

### Install dependencies and run the app

```bash

npm install
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
